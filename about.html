    <h3>Who are we?</h3>

    <p>Unequal Care is a nonprofit organization that fights against inequality in healthcare in the Philippines at its root cause. At Unequal Care, we believe that access to qualit healthcare is a basic human right, and not a privilege determined by race, class or background. Since 2016, our organization is dedicated to dismantling the barriers that keep marginalized communities from receiving the care they deserve.
</p>

    <p>Healthcare inequality in the Philippines is not just about limited resources. It is deeply tied to structural racism and systemic discrimination. We work to confront these causes through community advocacy, research, education, and policy reform.
</p>

    <p>We are made up of healthcare professionals, passionate advocates, and volunteers who work to create a future where every Filipino can walk into a health center and get the attention and medicine they need, and a future where healthcare professionals can give their patients proper care</p>
