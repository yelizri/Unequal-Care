    <p style="font-size: larger;clear: both;">Structural Racism is a type of racism where laws, institutional, and organizational policies that are made over time give an advantage to a certain group of people, and has unfair treatment to another group based on their race or ethnicity. Structural racism comes from a pattern of economic, cultural, and social differences between groups, and grows into a “norm” especially in policies.

	Structural Racism is a serious problem and can lead to higher risks of disease and death in certain racial or ethnic groups. Because this type of racism comes from the scaffolding, or root of the system itself, which is our laws, it is important to identify and move forward from this type of racism in particular. Especially when the way it harms people is avoidable.

      <h4 style="font-size: 25px;">What is being done about it?</h4>
      <p>National programs like the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth), are among others that seek to bridge the disparity in healthcare and bring equal access to it for Filipinos. 

Additionally, Primary healthcare is delivered by Barangay Health Centers (BHC). These are community-based clinics run by volunteers, and provide a range of services. They adjust their fees depending on income and family size.

      <h4 style="font-size: 25px;">Why is it important?</h4>
        <p>Structural Racism is a serious problem and can lead to higher risks of disease and death in certain areas that lack hospitals <br> For example, the whole of Region 11 has 5 Level 3 hospitals. A level 3 hospital should have a training program and residency program in 4 major clinical services, a physical medicin and rehab unit, a bloodbank, a pharmacy, a dialysis unit, an outpatient surgery center, a licensed laboratory, and and imaging facility. These hospitals also include all the facilities needed for level 1 and level 2 hospitals. (“PART I Introduction: CLASSIFICATION OF HOSPITALS,” 2013)

Again, the Davao region only has 5 of these hospitals. Among them, only 2 are public. 4 of them are in Davao City. Compared to Region 12’s 2 hospitals, this does not sound bad. But compared to Metro Manila’s 57 Level 3 hospitals, we can see the obvious disparity.

      <h4 style="font-size: 25px;">In the Philippines</h4>
      <p>In the Philippines, structural racism is one of the biggest problems faced hindering proper healthcare. There is a significant gap in healthcare access between wealthy and poor Filipinos. Cities in places like Metro Manila have many newer hospitals, meanwhile about 70-80 million Filipinos do not have access to this, and many rarely, or never, see a doctor (Evangelista et al., 2022). 

About 50% of Filipinos lack even primary care. This is because many live in remote areas, and a lot of places lack healthcare providers or professionals. Hospitals are condensed into certain areas, and then are dispersed unevenly.
